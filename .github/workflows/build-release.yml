          # General Information

          This release contains UCI-compatible chess engines designed to play intentionally weak chess for testing, learning and entertainment.

          ## Engines Included:

          - **Random Engine**: Plays completely random legal moves
          - **Alphabetical Engine**: Always picks the first move alphabetically (by SAN)
          - **Reverse Alphabetical Engine**: Always picks the last move alphabetically (by SAN)
          - **Pi Engine**: Uses Pi's fractional part to pick a move index (~14% through the list)
          - **Euler Engine**: Uses e's fractional part to pick a move index (~72% through the list)
          - **Suicide King**: Aggressively moves the king toward the opponent's king
          - **Blunder Engine**: Intentionally searches for and plays very bad moves
          - **Greedy Capture Engine**: Always captures when possible, ignoring safety
          - **Shuffle Engine**: Moves pieces back and forth, wasting tempo
          - **Anti-Positional Engine**: Deliberately violates positional principles
          - **Color Square Engine**: Tries to move all its pieces onto squares matching its own color (white or black).
          - **Opposite Color Square Engine**: Tries to move all its pieces onto squares matching the opponent's color (white or black).
          - **Swarm Engine**: Coordinates multiple pieces to swarm the opponent's position.
          - **Huddle Engine**: Groups pieces together for mutual support and defense.
          - **Runaway Engine**: Attempts to escape from threats by moving pieces away from danger.
          - **Mirror Y Engine**: Mirrors opponent's moves along the Y-axis.
          - **Mirror X Engine**: Mirrors opponent's moves along the X-axis.
          - **Reverse Start Engine**: Starts with pieces in reverse order and plays accordingly.
          - **CCCP Engine**: A quirky engine that plays in a Soviet-themed style. checkmate, check, capture and push.
          - **Passafist Engine**: An engine that prefers to pass its turn whenever possible, leading to very passive play.
          - **Single Player Engine**: An classical basic engine but thinks it's only allowed to make moves and not the opponent.
          - **Strangler Engine**: An engine that focuses minimizing its opponents moves in the next turn.
          - **Mover Engine**: An engine that focuses on moving pieces towards the center of the board.
          - **Opening Book Engine**: An engine that plays moves from a predefined opening book.
          - **Rare Opening Book Engine**: An engine that plays moves from a rare and uncommon opening book.
          - **Lawyer Engine**: Tries to maximize its legal moves.
          - **Criminal Engine**: Tries to minimize its own legal moves.
          - **Paralegal Engine**: This engine tries to maximize it's opponent's legal moves.

          ## Tournament Results

          ${{ steps.tournament_table.outputs.table_part1 }}
          ${{ steps.tournament_table.outputs.table_part2 }}
          ${{ steps.tournament_table.outputs.table_part3 }}

          📊 **Full tournament results with all engines are also available in the release assets:**
          - `tournament_results.md` - Full markdown table with all engines
          - `tournament_results.csv` - Raw CSV data
          - `tournament_games.pgn` - All game records in PGN format

          ## Platform Support:

          - Windows (x64)
          - Linux (x64)

          ## Usage:

          1. Download the appropriate ZIP for your platform from this release
          2. Extract the executable(s) and run or register them in any UCI-compatible GUI
          3. Optionally copy the executables into your chess GUI engines folder

          ## Notes:

          - These engines are intentionally weak and meant for testing, education and fun.
          - If you need macOS builds later, we can re-add macOS to the matrix.
